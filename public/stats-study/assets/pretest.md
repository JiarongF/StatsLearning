# Definition of Correlation:

Correlations describe the strength of the relationship between two numerical variables, such as height and weight.

On the next few pages you will see scatterplots showing correlations that range between 0 (no relationship) and 1 (a strong positive relationship).

Please make your best guess as to what the correlation is for these graphs.
