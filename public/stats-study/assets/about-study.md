# Introduction

In this study, you will be asked to determine the correlation between the points in a scatterplot. You will be shown one scatterplot at a time, and asked to enter a number that represents the correlation between the points (rounded to one decimal in 0.1 increments). 

This study should take about ten minutes, including some time to answer survey questions after the different trials with the scatterplots.
