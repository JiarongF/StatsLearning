# Introduction

In this study, you will be asked to determine the correlation between the points in a scatterplot. You will be shown one scatterplot at a time, and asked to enter a number that represents the correlation between the points (rounded to one decimal in 0.1 increments). 

Throughout the study, please narrate your thoughts out loud since this will help us better understand how you approach the task. Doing this when you feel stuck in the task or unsure will be especially helpful. We will also record your screen, and will be able to see when and where you move your cursor, where you click, and so on.

This study should take about ten minutes, including some time to answer survey questions after the different trials with the scatterplots.
