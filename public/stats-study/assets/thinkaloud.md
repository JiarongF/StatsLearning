# 🎙️ Think-aloud reminder!

Please talk through your thoughts as you work-— what you notice, what you expect to happen, and why you are taking particular steps. 

If you go quiet, no worries—- please just pick up narrating again when you remember. 

It’s also helpful to say when something is confusing or buggy!
